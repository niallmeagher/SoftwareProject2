- The board is implemented as an 8x8 array that holds the state of each tile (black, white, or neutral) within a larger game struct that holds pointers to current and next player.
- The players are implemented as stucts containing their name, score, team, and the char shorthand for their tokens ('B' for black, 'W' for white).
