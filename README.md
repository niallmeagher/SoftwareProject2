- The board is implemented as an 8x8 array that holds the state of each tile (black, white, or neutral) within a larger game struct that also holds pointers to current and next player.
- The players are implemented as stucts containing their name, score, team, and the char shorthand for their tokens ('B' for black, 'W' for white).
- The only condition for a player to pass is if they have no available moves, therefore it makes more sense to auto-pass for the player to avoid confusion about whether there are valid moves.
- Game logic is implemented as follows:
    - a move is valid if it is adjacent to at least one enemy token
    - a move must enclose at least one enemy token in a straight line between the newly placed token and another friendly token with no empty tiles in between
    - to determine this, the program takes the coordinates of the desired tile and searches in all 8 directions extending from that tile as the origin.
    - for each direction, if the adjacent tile holds an enemy token, it checks the next tile along that line for an enemy token, until it reaches the end of the "string" of enemy tokens
        - if the sequence-ending tile holds a friendly token, then the enemy tokens are enclosed and the move is valid
        - if the sequence-ending tile is empty or the edge of the board is reached, then that move is invalid.
    - Once a move has been validated in at least one direction, the program checks validity in each individual direction. For each direction the move is valid in, the program starts back at the origin and traces along that line again, this time turning over all enemy tokens to friendly tokens and adjusting the score until the enclosing friendly token is reached.
    - Once both players have to pass their turn consecutively or one player's score reaches zero, the game ends and a report giving the date, time, and score is appended to to a .txt file.
